There is one SaaS solution for new startup NGOs with little IT and accounting knowledge. There is another SaaS solution suitable for medium and large scale NGOs. As for open source platforms, there is one option that can be expanded to an ERP1 solution with HR and volunteer management functionalities. Another open source option provides basic accounting features and allows for expansion by purchasing third party apps.</p> <p>We have included a decision tree to assist NGOs in selecting an appropriate solution as well as an implementation summary for each recommended open source platform.</p> <p>Note this report offers a general overview and evaluation of available financial management solutions.

Users access the service via browsers or mobile apps and pay a monthly or yearly subscription based on the service tier and number of users. On-premise installation and maintenance of software is not necessary. Additional hardware is also not normally required. SaaS solutions are usually turn-key solutions with intuitive user interfaces, requiring minimal customization effort. Hosting and security are usually taken care of.</p> <p>Open source software is normally free to download and install. Users can view and modify its source code according to specific requirements. The software can be hosted on public clouds or on a local server. It is known for its flexibility and control. There is however associated hardware or hosting cost, requirement on inhouse IT staff for coding, implementation, customization, security setup and maintenance.

This will ensure that the client can run the software on their system.</p> <p>We also inquire if the vendor offers mobile applications for iOS and Android devices.</p> <h3 id="customer-support"><a href="#customer-support" class="header-anchor">#</a> Customer support</h3> <p>Customer support options vary depending on the pricing plan users select, but they usually include email, phone (24/7 or 24/5), online ticketing, live chat, and a knowledge base. Choosing a software which offers ample support resources ensures that we have someone to contact in case we run into technical issues.</p> <h3 id="pricing"><a href="#pricing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pricing</h3> <p>For each software shortlisted, we identified pricing-related details such as upfront cost, ongoing cost, free trial details, and any special rates, discounts, or promotions.</p> <h2 id="scoring"><a href="#scoring" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scoring</h2> <p>In each section, we rate the softwares on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). This has been done by researching the software’s official website, documentation, community forums and analyzing user reviews on popular software review websites such as GetApp, G2, TrustRadius, SourceForge and Capterra.</p> <p>Full scale: 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = average, 4 = good, and 5 = excellent.</p> <p>If a vendor doesn't offer a listed function, we leave the score field as 0.</p> <p>Finally total scores are calculated by the weighted sum of the individual sections. The higher the total score, the a specific vendor meets our criteria. Weighting assigned to each criteria is based on project members’ experience and finding from interviews. Clients are encouraged to review the weighting based on their specific environments.</p> <p>A detailed evaluation matrix is available at the following link: https://bit.ly/3oHB6YR.</p> <p>A summary of the feature evaluation is shown in the scoring table, with total score and corresponding ranking, and heatmap below.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Software Score Summary</th> <th></th> <th></th> <th></th> <th></th> <th></th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td></td> <td>SaaS</td> <td></td> <td>Open-source</td> <td></td> <td></td></tr> <tr><td></td> <td>Quickbooks Online</td> <td>Zoho Books</td> <td>ERPNext</td> <td>Akaunting</td> <td>Weight</td></tr> <tr><td>Essential Features</td> <td>42</td> <td>33</td> <td>35</td> <td>23</td> <td>40%</td></tr> <tr><td>Other Features</td> <td>19</td> <td>22</td> <td>29</td> <td>20</td> <td>10%</td></tr> <tr><td>Customer Support</td> <td>16</td> <td>10</td> <td>4</td> <td>4</td> <td>10%</td></tr> <tr><td>Operating Specifications</td> <td>31</td> <td>30</td> <td>26</td> <td>26</td> <td>20%</td></tr> <tr><td>Pricing</td> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> <td>5</td> <td>5.5</td> <td>20%</td></tr> <tr><td>Total Score</td> <td>27.9</td> <td>24.0</td> <td>23.5</td> <td>17.9</td> <td></td></tr> <tr><td>Rank</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td></td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="result-discussion"><a href="#result-discussion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Result Discussion</h2> <p>Quickbooks online achieves the best ranking with well-rounded performance in every criteria we evaluate. It is most suitable for medium and large organisations with knowledgeable financial staff. Zoho books comes second in the ranking offering a good range of basic accounting features free of charge and reasonable tiers of subscription fee for additional features. It is suitable for startup NGOs with a general lack of accounting knowledge amongst staff. ERPNext earns third in our ranking, behind SaaS solutions particularly due to its lack of customer support and the fact that open-source software requires well-versed IT staff and possibly additional hardware and software implementation. The ranking may rise if aforementioned requirements are available. ERPNext does offer a reasonable suite of ERP functions which may appeal to medium and large organisations. Akaunting comes last in the ranking as it offers less basic features with its free installation offer. Additional purchase for some relevant functionalities from third party integration may be required.</p> <p>A summary of the detail evaluation is provided in Table 4, displayed in the form of a heat map.
